== Description ==

Whisper Comment Reloaded is a WordPress plugin for commenters to control comment visibility for other viewers. A 'whisper' is a comment that is only displayed for targeted viewers. Viewers who are not authorised to view the whisper, will only see the replacement text instead.

This is a great plugin to use for a class blog where a classroom blog can have multiple authors where the teacher/professor may want to add private notes for the student instead of making a public comment.

== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file and extract its content to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin by navigating to Settings > Whisper Comment Reloaded

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will whisper comments be hidden in comment feeds? =

Yes. In fact, as long as function 'comment_text()' is used for display comment content, all whispers will be protected.
